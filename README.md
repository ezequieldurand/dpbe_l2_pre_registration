## Study Information

### Title (required)

How bilinguals perceive speech depends on which language they think they're hearing: A replication study  


### Description (optional)

Research has been done to determine if bilinguals, in Spanish and English, are able to shift their voicing perception across aural controlled language contexts that are cued conceptually and perceptually (Gonzales & Lotto, 2013). An extension of that study was conducted by Gonzalez et al. (2017) where the researchers cued the language context only conceptually, while using both Spanish-English bilinguals and French-English bilinguals and demonstrated that with only conceptual knowledge, bilinguals were still able to adjust their voicing perception. Casillas & Simonet (2018) conducted a study replicating the Gonzales and Lotto (2013) study specifically through its methodology, where the cue for the language mode was conducted perceptually through an auditory stimuli. In that study, the researchers analyzed the double phonemic boundary effect in early and late bilinguals using a stimulus induced language mode that showed that early bilinguals, but not the lower proficient learners had effect of a double phonemic boundary. For the present study we will be analyzing the double phonemic boundary effect using Spanish-English early and late bilinguals with a context conceptually induced language mode.  


### Research questions 

Evidence suggests that late second-language learners of Spanish are able to display language-specific perceptual boundaries (Casillas & Simonet 2018) and that early Spanish-English bilinguals adjust their identification boundary based on conceptual knowledge of the language context (Gonzales et al 2019).  

This study aims to address the following research questions:  

1. Are late second-language learners able to adjust their speech perception using only conceptual cues in the same way as early bilinguals?  

2. Does proficiency level have an effect on their perceptual categorization habits of the /b/-/p/ continuum? 


### Hypotheses (required)

We hypothesize that the present study will replicate earlier findings demonstrating that:  

- Bilingual listeners perceptually adjust to changes in pronunciation across languages based on their conceptual understanding of which language they are currently hearing (non-directional)  

- If this hypothesis is not rejected by our data, more evidence will be provided to support the existence of some separation between the phonemic systems in bilinguals' minds (non-directional)  

- Second language learners with higher proficiency levels will be more likely to display the double phonemic boundary effect than the less proficient learners (directional)


## Design Plan

### Study type (required)

- Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments. This is also known as an intervention experiment and includes randomized controlled trials.


### Blinding (required)

- The experiment is a single blind study. None of the participants know which group they 
belong to. All participants, however, will be exposed to all stimuli.

- Researchers will randomly assign participants to groups. 


### Study design (required)

Participants will have to complete a forced-choice task in wich they will be asked to categorize a /b/-/p/ acoustic continuum. The present study will be a within-subject study, since all of the participants will complete the task in English and Spanish mode. 


### Randomization (optional)

There will be randomization in the order in which the participants complete the two tasks: half of them will start in English mode and the other half in Spanish mode. 


## Sampling Plan

### Existing Data (required)

- Registration prior to creation of data 


### Explanation of existing data (optional)

We do not have exisiting data.


### Data collection procedures (required)

One hundred and twenty participants will be recruited for this study. While bilingual participants will be undergraduate and graduate students at Rutgers University, monolingual participants will be college students at a Latin American or Spanish university. Participants will be divided in four groups: thirty simultaneous Spanish-English bilinguals, thirty intermediate English second language learners of Spanish, thirty advanced English second language learners of Spanish, and thirty Spanish monolingual participants. The first three groups of participants will receive either extra credit or monetary compensation for their voluntary participation in this study. 
The data collection period will last for roughly three weeks, beginning March 25th, 2019.


### Sample size (required)

The sample pool of participants will be around 120 second language learners at Rutgers University. All participants will have learned Spanish as a second language after the age of 13. 


### Sample size rationale (optional)

We are collecting around 120 second language learners to have a normal distribution of  proficiency levels.


## Variables

### Manipulated variables (optional)

The manipulated variables are the following:  

- Resynthesized acoustic continua of bafri-pafri, where we will manipulate the VOTs of the /b/ and /p/ sounds.  

- Language context (English or Spanish).  


### Measured variables (required)

The measured variables are:

- "Bafri"/"Pafri" responses in a two-alternative forced-choice labeling task, according to the resynthesized continua.


## Analysis Plan

### Statistical models (required)

Each participant's identification reponses of the forced choice test will be fitted to a binary logisitic regression model (see Gonzales et al 2019). This model will be used to predict the probability of participant response along the VOT continuum.
