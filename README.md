## Study Information

### Title (required)

**Provide the working title of your study. It may be the same title that you submit for publication of your final manuscript, but it is not a requirement.**





### Description (optional)

**Please give a brief description of your study, including some background, the purpose of the study, or broad research questions.**

**Ex.**  

**Though there is strong evidence to suggest that sugar affects taste preferences, the effect has never been demonstrated in brownies. Therefore, we will measure taste preference for four different levels of sugar concentration in a standard brownie recipe to determine if the effect exists in this pastry.**

**(The description should be no longer than the length of an abstract. It can give some context for the proposed study, but great detail is not needed here for your preregistration.)**




### Hypotheses (required)

**List specific, concise, and testable hypotheses. Please state if the hypotheses are directional or non-directional. If directional, state the direction. A predicted effect is also appropriate here. If a specific interaction or moderation is important to your research, you can list that as a separate hypothesis.**








## Design Plan

### Study type (required)

**Please check one of the following statements**

- Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments. This is also known as an intervention experiment and includes randomized controlled trials.
- Observational Study - Data is collected from study subjects that are not randomly assigned to a treatment. This includes surveys, “natural experiments,” and regression discontinuity designs.
- Meta-Analysis - A systematic review of published studies.
- Other




### Blinding (required)

**Blinding describes who is aware of the experimental manipulations within a study. Mark all that apply.**

- No blinding is involved in this study.
- For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the treatment group to which they have been assigned.
- Personnel who interact directly with the study subjects (either human or non-human subjects) will not be aware of the assigned treatments. (Commonly known as “double blind”)
- Personnel who analyze the data collected from the study are not aware of the treatment applied to any given group.





### Is there any additional blinding in this study? (optional)

**Add information here**



### Study design (required)

**Describe your study design. Examples include two-group, factorial, randomized block, and repeated measures. Is it a between (unpaired), within-subject (paired), or mixed design? Describe any counterbalancing required. Typical study designs for observation studies include cohort, cross sectional, and case-control studies.**



### Randomization (optional)

**If you are doing a randomized study, how will you randomize, and at what level?**







## Sampling Plan

### Existing Data (required)

**Preregistration is designed to make clear the distinction between confirmatory tests, specified prior to seeing the data, and exploratory analyses conducted after observing the data. Therefore, creating a research plan in which existing data will be used presents unique challenges. Please select the description that best describes your situation. Please see https://cos.io/prereg for more information.**

- Registration prior to creation of data 
- Registration prior to any human observation of the data 
- Registration prior to accessing the data 
- Registration prior to analysis of the data 
- Registration following analysis of the data 




### Explanation of existing data (optional)

**If you indicate that you will be using some data that already exist in this study, please describe the steps you have taken to assure that you are unaware of any patterns or summary statistics in the data. This may include an explanation of how access to the data has been limited, who has observed the data, or how you have avoided observing any analysis of the specific data you will use in your study.**




### Data collection procedures (required)

**Please describe the process by which you will collect your data. If you are using human subjects, this should include the population from which you obtain subjects, recruitment efforts, payment for participation, how subjects will be selected for eligibility from the initial pool (e.g. inclusion and exclusion rules), and your study timeline. For studies that don't include human subjects, include information about how you will collect samples, duration of data gathering efforts, source or location of samples, or batch numbers you will use.**




### Sample size (required)

**Describe the sample size of your study. How many units will be analyzed in the study? This could be the number of people, birds, classrooms, plots, interactions, or countries included. If the units are not individuals, then describe the size requirements for each unit. If you are using a clustered or multilevel design, how many units are you collecting at each level of the analysis?**




### Sample size rationale (optional)

**This could include a power analysis or an arbitrary constraint such as time, money, or personnel.**



### Stopping rule (optional)

**If your data collection procedures do not give you full control over your exact sample size, specify how you will decide when to terminate your data collection.**








## Variables

### Manipulated variables (optional)

**Describe all variables you plan to manipulate and the levels or treatment arms of each variable. This is not applicable to any observational study.**





### Measured variables (required)

**Describe each variable that you will measure. This will include outcome measures, as well as any predictors or covariates that you will measure. You do not need to include any variables that you plan on collecting if they are not going to be included in the confirmatory analyses of this study.**




### Indices (optional)

**If any measurements are going to be combined into an index (or even a mean), what measures will you use and how will they be combined? Include either a formula or a precise description of your method. If you are using a more complicated statistical method to combine measures (e.g. a factor analysis), you can note that here but describe the exact method in the analysis plan section.**







## Analysis Plan

### Statistical models (required)

**What statistical model will you use to test each hypothesis? Please include the type of model (e.g. ANOVA, multiple regression, SEM, etc) and the specification of the model (this includes each variable that will be included as predictors, outcomes, or covariates). Please specify any interactions, subgroup analyses, pairwise or complex contrasts, or follow-up tests from omnibus tests. If you plan on using any positive controls, negative controls, or manipulation checks you may mention that here. Remember that any test not included here must be noted as an exploratory test in your final article.**




### Transformations (optional)

**If you plan on transforming, centering, recoding the data, or will require a coding scheme for categorical variables, please describe that process.**




### Inference criteria (optional)

**What criteria will you use to make inferences? Please describe the information you’ll use (e.g. specify the p-values, Bayes factors, specific model fit indices), as well as cut-off criterion, where appropriate. Will you be using one or two tailed tests for each of your analyses? If you are comparing multiple conditions or testing multiple hypotheses, will you account for this?**




### Data exclusion (optional)

**How will you determine which data points or samples if any to exclude from your analyses? How will outliers be handled? Will you use any awareness check?**




### Missing data (optional)

**How will you deal with incomplete or missing data?**




### Exploratory analysis (optional)

**If you plan to explore your data set to look for unexpected differences or relationships, you may describe those tests here. An exploratory test is any test where a prediction is not made up front, or there are multiple possible tests that you are going to use. A statistically significant finding in an exploratory test is a great way to form a new confirmatory hypothesis, which could be registered at a later time.**

**If there is any additional information that you feel needs to be included in your preregistration, please enter it here. Literature cited, disclosures of any related work such as replications or work that uses the same data, or other context that will be helpful for future readers would be appropriate here.**
